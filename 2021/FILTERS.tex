\item A speech signal, band limited to 4 kHz, is sampled at 1.25 times the Nyquist rate. The speech samples, assumed to be statistically independent and uniformly distributed in the range -5 V to +5 V, are subsequently quantized in an 8-bit uniform quantizer and then over a voice-grade AWGN telephone channel. If the ratio of transmitted signal power to channel noise power is 26 dB, the minimum channel bandwidth required to ensure reliable transmission of the signal with arbitrarily small probability of transmission error (\textit{rounded off to one decimal place}) is \rule{1cm}{0.15mm} kHz.

Consider a carrier signal which is amplitude modulated by a single-tone sinusoidal message signal with a modulation index of $50\%$. If the carrier and one of the sidebands are suppressed in the modulated signal, the percentage of power saved (rounded off to one decimal place) is \ldots.
