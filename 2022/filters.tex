\item A circuit with an ideal OPAMP is shown. The Bode plot for the magnitude (in dB)
 of the gain transfer function $ \brak{A \brak{j \omega}} = \dfrac{ V_{out}\brak{j \omega}}{V_{in}\brak{j \omega}}$ of the circuit is also
provided (here, $\omega$ is the angular frequency in $ rad/s $). The values of $R$ and $C$ are

\item A speech signal, band limited to 4 kHz, is sampled at 1.25 times the Nyquist rate. The speech samples, assumed to be statistically independent and uniformly distributed in the range -5 V to +5 V, are subsequently quantized in an 8-bit uniform quantizer and then over a voice-grade AWGN telephone channel. If the ratio of transmitted signal power to channel noise power is 26 dB, the minimum channel bandwidth required to ensure reliable transmission of the signal with arbitrarily small probability of transmission error (\textit{rounded off to one decimal place}) is \rule{1cm}{0.15mm} kHz.
